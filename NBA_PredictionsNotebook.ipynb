    "There are two datasets in this projects. First one contains relative score differential and total score of each game of each team scrapped by me from ESPN. The other dataset is the \"Advanced Team Statistics\" of each team againg scrapped by me from Fox Sport on each day of the 2018-2019 season. You can go over databases, we have shared them. The statistics datasets have almost every predictor we want to train our model except the Home/Away information which we will calculate using schedule/score dataset and add it to our training dataset."

    "Although we have data of the whole season the model we want to build is going to use only the previous data to predict a game. For example if we want to predict 44th game of the season for Timberwolves the model will only use previous games to train and will predict the result of 44th game. Besides, model will not use the statistics of the team that we want to predict its game but its opponents'. What I mean is we will use previous opponents statistics as explanatory variables and the score of the game against that opponent as response variable and to predict 44th game of the season for Timberwolves we will give the statistics of the opponent to the model to predict the result of that game.
